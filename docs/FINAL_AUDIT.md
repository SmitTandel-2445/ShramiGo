# ShramiGo Final Audit

## Overall status

The MVP was hardened substantially and the repository now has reproducible migrations, real backend-backed admin authentication, frontend role guards, authoritative booking validation, Decimal money storage, persisted payment intents, explicit failure states, and setup/security documentation.

The requested payment adapter, signed webhook flow, refresh-token rotation/revocation, Redis rate limiting, coordinate discovery, and PostgreSQL-gated concurrent booking implementation are present. Production deployment still requires real Razorpay/Redis credentials; the PostgreSQL concurrency test was not executed in this environment because `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is absent.

## Fixed

- Removed startup `Base.metadata.create_all()` behavior.
- Added environment-driven API/configuration and strong secret validation.
- Added JWT `iat` and `jti` claims with a 30-minute default access-token lifetime.
- Added backend reusable role dependencies and frontend customer/worker/admin route guards.
- Replaced frontend-only admin navigation with backend credential authentication and role verification.
- Added `/api/ready` database readiness check.
- Required an explicit booking service and removed first-service fallback behavior.
- Validated active/verified worker, service ownership, future date/time, configured weekday availability, and overlapping booking intervals.
- Added worker row locking where supported and a persisted payment intent at booking creation.
- Rejected direct client claims of online payment success.
- Converted booking, payment, service, and worker-service currency fields to Decimal/Numeric.
- Added worker payout separation and corrected admin revenue semantics to platform service charge.
- Made booking notifications transactional instead of silently swallowing persistence failures.
- Replaced report fixture data with live admin metrics and retryable errors.
- Removed customer-facing fixed location and non-provider payment copy.
- Implemented Razorpay provider abstraction, order creation, checkout signature verification, signed webhook processing, event idempotency, and payment state transitions.
- Implemented cash payment persistence and authorized worker/admin cash-receipt confirmation without requiring Razorpay.
- Implemented hashed rotating refresh tokens with logout revocation.
- Implemented shared Redis login throttling with configurable IP/email windows and graceful Redis outage behavior.
- Implemented validated worker/customer coordinates and `/api/workers/nearby` Haversine search with filters and pagination.
- Added a real PostgreSQL-gated concurrent booking race test using the booking business function and row locking.
- Added the frontend `npm run lint` gate using the repository's TypeScript compiler.
- Required explicit service choice in the booking UI.
- Added initial backend tests and documentation.

## Files and migrations

Major changed areas include:

- Backend configuration/security: `backend/app/core/config.py`, `backend/app/core/security.py`, `backend/app/dependencies.py`, `backend/app/main.py`.
- Booking/payment/financial model and routes: `backend/app/models/booking.py`, `payment.py`, `service.py`, `worker_service.py`, `backend/app/routers/bookings.py`, `admin.py`.
- Frontend routing/auth/API: `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, admin login, `frontend/src/services/api.ts`.
- Admin live data and booking/payment UI: admin pages, `BookService.tsx`, `Payment.tsx`, `CustomerPages.tsx`.
- Migrations: `backend/alembic/`, `backend/alembic.ini`.
- Tests: `backend/tests/`, `backend/pytest.ini`.
- Docs: `README.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `API.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `BOOKING_FLOW.md`, `PAYMENT_FLOW.md`.

Migrations added:

1. Initial production schema.
2. Separate `bookings.worker_payout` column.
3. Refresh-token, payment event, and profile-coordinate schema changes.

Existing deployments with float currency columns and nullable service IDs require a reviewed data migration before applying these constraints to production data.

## API and security changes

- Admin login now uses `POST /api/auth/login` and requires role `admin`.
- Admin APIs remain server-side role protected.
- Added `GET /api/ready`.
- Direct `PUT /api/bookings/{booking_id}/payment` no longer marks payment paid; provider verification is required.
- `PUT /api/bookings/{booking_id}/cash-received` confirms cash only for the assigned worker or an admin.
- Frontend API base URL uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- CORS uses explicit configured origins.

## Booking and payment status

Booking validation is server-side and conflict-aware; PostgreSQL row locking is used for the worker serialization point. A database-level time-range exclusion strategy and PostGIS can be added later for higher-scale deployments. Razorpay order creation, checkout verification, webhook idempotency, and payment state transitions are implemented. Refund initiation still requires an authorized operational endpoint before it can be exposed to users.

## Verification commands

- `cd backend; pytest -q` -> 16 passed, 1 skipped: `PostgreSQL integration test skipped: TEST_DATABASE_URL is not configured.`
- `cd backend; python -m compileall -q .` -> passed.
- `cd backend; alembic upgrade head` against a clean SQLite validation database -> passed.
- `cd frontend; npm run lint` -> passed with warnings only.
- `cd frontend; npm run typecheck` -> passed.
- `cd frontend; npm run build` -> passed, with only the existing Vite chunk-size warning.

To execute the PostgreSQL concurrency test against a dedicated database:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/shramsetu_test"
pytest
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/shramsetu_test"
pytest
```

## Required environment variables

Backend:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SECRET_KEY` (random, at least 32 characters)
- `ALGORITHM`
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`
- `FRONTEND_URL`
- `CORS_ORIGINS`
- `TIMEZONE`
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`
- `REDIS_URL`
- `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_IP`
- `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_EMAIL`
- `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
- `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `RAZORPAY_CURRENCY`

Frontend:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

Razorpay variables must contain sandbox or live credentials supplied outside source control. Redis must be a shared deployment service for multi-instance rate limiting.

## Deployment checklist

- Provision PostgreSQL and run `alembic upgrade head`.
- Set strong secrets and explicit CORS origins.
- Serve frontend/API over HTTPS.
- Disable debug mode.
- Configure admin provisioning outside public registration.
- Configure Razorpay webhook URL and verify a sandbox payment and replayed webhook.
- Configure shared Redis and observe rate-limit errors/counters.
- Run the PostgreSQL concurrency integration test with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`.
- Add an authorized refund endpoint before exposing refunds in the UI.
- Exclude `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `dist`, and `__pycache__` from delivery archives.
